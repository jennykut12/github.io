## Possible Exam Questions

### So remember that for the exam. 

1. The physical tokens come from third parties.

2. it's important to note that with IAM, we never need to select a region. So that's something that pops up in exam questions quite a lot. 

Where you get some kind of scenario, where users are being added to some other geographical area in the world and you need to know what to do with their accounts and how to set up their accounts. Well, with IAM, you only ever have the accounts in one place and you can use those accounts with any region around the world.
